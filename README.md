Readme: Preparation for running the project colab notebook
Team 99: Jihan Zhang, Zesheng Liu, Ziyi You
To run the project colab notebook, you need to create a folder called 'Project' in
you Google Drive just under the path '/Mydrive' , and then upload all the dataset
into the Project folder. All the dataset then should get a path like `/Mydrive/Project/
csv_files.
The right folder in Google Drive should be similar to this graph.
For this project, we use several dataset. The main dataset is from Kaggle:Climate
Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data. As it is a big dataset, we do not upload it
together with the colab notebook. Before running the notebook, you could
download it from the link. Our additional dataset is from World Bank, and we
modify some raw columns names to make it more readable. We attached all the
additional dataset with the submission. So you could directly upload it to the
project folder.
